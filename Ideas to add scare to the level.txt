Add more grime, rubble and dark colors.
Dark areas

---------------------------------------------------------


You come across a door that triggers a sound clip to play (trigger infront of door)

 "Pssst, hey!" (insane gigeling)
 "Can you go get me some of those glowy mushrooms?"

 (insane gigeling)

 "I locked myself in here"

So you have to go find and collect a few of these mushrooms.

When you return to the door you see its open.

There will be another trigger that triggers the insane giggle down the tunnle (3D Sound) (the door will be around a bend so the trigger needs to activate when the player comes around the bend)

the player can now enter the room
